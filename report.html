The following set up is used to execute all the experiments. 
<ol>

	<li> Operating system :Linux mint </li>
	<li> R version: 4.0.2 </li>
	<li> R studio: Version 1.3.1093 </li>
</ol>


All the reports mentioned in APA style at the end of each test. 

For reference, some of the reports have been reported here from prepare, model and explore page. 

<ol>
	<li> Reporting normality : Second period grade was assessed for normality. Visual inspection of the histogram and QQ-Plot did not exhibhit any issues with skewness and kurtosis. The standardized score for skewness(1.91) and the standardized score for kurtosis (-0.70) was can be considered acceptable using the criteria proposed by West, Finch and Curran (1996). 100% of standardized scores for grade 2 fall within the bounds +/- 3.29, using  the guidance of Field, Miles and Field (2013) the data can be considered to be a normal distribution (m=12.23, sd=2.47, n=382). </li>
	<li> Reporting correlation: The relationship between age and family support was investigated using a Kendall correlation. A weak positive correlation was found (tau =0.11, n=380, p=0.02). </li>

	<li> Reporting difference test with Cohen's d effect: An independent-samples t-test was conducted to compare grade obtained in test 2 for students who have family support and those who do not have family support. No significant difference in the scores for grade obtained was found (M=12.06, SD= 2.61 for respondents who do not have family support, M= 12.34, SD= 2.38 for students who have family support), (t(382)= -1.05, p = 0.29). Cohen's d also indicated a very small effect size (-0.11). </li>

	<li> Reporting difference test with eta squared effect: An independent-samples t-test was conducted to compare grade obtained in test 2 for students who have family support and those who do not have family support. No significant difference in the scores for grade obtained was found (M=12.06, SD= 2.61 for respondents who do not have family support, M= 12.34, SD= 2.38 for students who have family support), (t(382)= -1.05, p = 0.29). A very small effect size was also indicated by the eta squared value (0.003). </li>

	<li> Reporting differences for Mann-whitney test: A Mann-Whitney test indicated that the final grade was significantly greater for students who have taken extra paid classes(Mdn = 12, IQR = 2.75) than for students who have not paid extra for classes(Mdn = 13, IQR = 3), (U = 5910.5, z = 2.38, p = .017, r = 0.12) </li>

	<li> Reporting linear regression: A simple linear regression was carried out to investigate whether total absences could significantly predict student's second period grade. A significant regression equation was found (F(1,380)=15.89 , p < .05 ), with an R2 of 0.04. Participants second period grade is equal to 12.61 - 0.1 (abesences), where absences represents number of days student missed the school. Absences is a significant predictor of second period grade.  </li>
